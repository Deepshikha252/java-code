PG-Life: A Recap
Hey,

Congratulations on almost completing this training :) 

By now, you have learned seven web technologies (HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, DBMS, PHP, JS, and React). All these web technologies are sufficient to create a functional web application which you have been already creating as a part of your assignments. 

In this module, we will walk through the code of the PG-Life web application so as to sediment our understanding of the code and logic used to create this web application. Also, there will be a few assignments which you need to complete and based on these assignments questions will come in the module test and final test.

We have already discussed in detail the code for the index.html (home page) and dashboard.html (dashboard page). If you want to revisit, you can click here to view the video.

componentDidMount() {
    const search = window.location.search;
    const params = new URLSearchParams(search);
    const city_name = params.get('city');
 
    fetch(`${base_path}/api/get_properties_by_city.php?city=${city_name}`)
      .then(response => response.json())
      .then(responseData => {
        this.setState({
          properties: responseData
        });
    })
      .catch(error => {
        console.log('Error fetching and parsing data', error);
      });
}

Execute the following commands in the command prompt to create a ‘react-app’ folder inside the PGLife folder. Please ensure that you execute the steps in the same order as given.

1) Windows users: cd\xampp\htdocs\PGLife
2) Linux (Ubuntu) users: cd /var/www/html/PGLife/
3) create-react-app react-app
4) cd react-app
5) npm start



Exercise
Now that you have coded the entire web application - PGLife, it is time to clean up the code before building the website using React.


Delete unnecessary files under 'src' folder:
App.css - we will not be writing new CSS, we will use the existing CSS.
App.test.js
index.css
logo.svg
reportWebVitals.js
setupTests.js  
The src folder should look like this (ignore the temp_files folder).



From index.js file:
Remove line: import './index.css';
Remove line: import reportWebVitals from './reportWebVitals';
Remove line: reportWebVitals();

Change base_path inside utils.js file.
The utils.js code should look like this.



 

Build
Open command prompt and go inside the react-app folder. Enter npm run build to build the project.
This will create a build folder like this.



Inside the build folder open and format index.html file.
There are still a few more things we need to take care of which we will see in the next video.
