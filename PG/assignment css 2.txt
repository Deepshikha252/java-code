To help you get started with the development of the web application, you can download this starting code. Please go through the code thoroughly - understand it line by line and similarly create the remaining web pages of the web application.

What is provided in the starting code?

Complete code of two web pages (Property list page and Property detail page) of PGLife web application.

What do you have to do?

Create two web pages from scratch (Home page and Dashboard page) using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap.

To create components such as navbar, carousel, breadcrumb, modal, and button - you can use  this link and download/copy the code as such from the web page. Customize the copied code at your convenience and use it to create the web application.

Some CSS files

To create the web application, you will need the following css files (use the below links as such to link these css file to your HTML file):

Bootstrap.min - 
<link href="css/bootstrap.min.css" rel="stylesheet" />

Font-awesome - This CSS file will help you to create the icons in the modals, amenities section, etc.
<link href="https://use.fontawesome.com/releases/v5.11.2/css/all.css" rel="stylesheet" />

Google fonts - you can use the following CSS for the open sans font used in the web application.
<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Open+Sans:ital,wght@0,300;0,400;0,600;0,700;0,800;1,300;1,400;1,600;1,700;1,800&display=swap" rel="stylesheet" />

 

Apart from this, you can create a ‘common.css’ file where you can include the CSS code that is common for all the web pages. And, to style the individual web pages - you can create their corresponding CSS files such as ‘home.css’ for index or home page and ‘dashboard.css’ for the dashboard page.
