Exercise
Now that you have learned how to use JOIN queries, here is an exercise for you. As you have already created a ‘placement’ database (if not already, please create the database and add relevant data) and the tables inside this database. Use the following JOIN queries and observe the output on your own.

Inner Join

SELECT
    *
FROM
    students
INNER JOIN
    companies
ON
    students.company_id=companies.id;
Left Join

SELECT
    *
FROM
    students
LEFT JOIN
    companies
ON
    students.company_id=companies.id;
Right Join

SELECT
    *
FROM
    students
RIGHT JOIN
    companies
ON
    students.company_id=companies.id;
